Everyone involved with Deis sends a smiling **thank you** to Keerthan Mala.

Keerthan joined the Engine Yard Deis team this summer as an intern. It wasn't
a hard choice: he was one of the smartest scheduling and distributed systems
students we could find.

Keerthan combined forces with Sivaram Mothiki to create a formidable scheduler
team. Keerthan owned Kubernetes (k8s), the new container cluster management
technology that has the Deis project fired up. He perservered--while the code
around him changed rapidly--to bring the
[Kubernetes Scheduler](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/customizing_deis/choosing-a-scheduler/#k8s-scheduler)
preview to Deis v1.9, allowing k8s to be used in place of the default `fleet`
scheduler. He also introduced `flannel` and `etcd2` into Deis.
Keerthan's always ready to help with debugging or product testing, and
he has steered the future technology direction of Deis as a key member of the
R&D team.

Keerthan returns to the East coast to finish off his master's degree now, but we
will keep his desk warm in hopes of a triumphant return. Best of luck, and thanks
again Keerthan for showing us what's next and for making the Boulder office fun!
