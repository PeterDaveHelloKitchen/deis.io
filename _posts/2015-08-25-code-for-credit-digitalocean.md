Today we are announcing a unique "code-for-credit" partnership with our friends at DigitalOcean. As part of this partnership, DigitalOcean will provide free hosting credits to developers who have code merged into the mainline Deis project.

When new contributors submit a pull request, they will be automatically provided information on how to collect and redeem DigitalOcean credits once the pull request is merged. The amount of credit received by each contributor will be based on the value of each contribution, as determined by the Deis project maintainers.

To learn more about the program, check out the [Hacking on Deis](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/contributing/hacking/) documentation.
