Deis is known to be one of the simplest-to-use PaaS solutions available on the market, but we as the Deis team have found that not everyone finds it the easiest one to set up. When I joined the Deis team a month or so ago, I took a stab at rethinking how someone could provision, test, and manage a Deis cluster. I've wrapped up my ideas and approach into a tool called [`rigger`](https://github.com/deis/rigger).


Now this is where we would like your help... if you've experienced any sort of hardship during provisioning, testing, or managing a long-living Deis cluster... *especially* if you have shied away from using Deis at all because it was too daunting to get set up...
