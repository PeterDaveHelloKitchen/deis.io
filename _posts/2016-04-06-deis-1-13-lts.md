Deis v1.13.0 is the final feature release for Deis. It is a Long Term Support (LTS) release, which means we will continue to patch bugs and accept pull requests, however any new features should be applied to [Deis Workflow](https://deis.com/), the successor to Deis.

Deis v1.13.0 bumps CoreOS to 899.13.0, updates the system's containers to Alpine 3.3, removes the scheduler technology previews, bumps the Heroku buildpacks to the latest stable versions, adds a healthcheck url `/healthz` to the controller, and allows logspout to re-discover the logger when it jumps to another control plane node.

If you are coming from an earlier version of Deis, please read the ["Upgrading Deis"](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/upgrading-deis/) documentation for details.

## What is Deis?

Deis is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## v1.13.0 Summary

### New Features

 - **deis-client** responds to `deis version`, `deis -v`, `deis --version` and `deis help version`
 - **deis-controller** now has a health check view at `/healthz`
 - There are graceful shutdown scripts for Ceph and Ceph-less nodes. See more [here](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/managing_deis/add_remove_host/)
 - **deis-controller** returns a 409 when cancelling a user account that has applications

### Improvements

 - **deis-router** now makes `vhost_traffic_status_zone` configurable
 - **deis-logspout** now continuously re-discovers the logger's connection information, should it be re-scheduled onto another host
 - **deis-controller** prevents overlapping `config:set` operations
 - **deis-client** only deletes `~/.deis/client.json` if you're cancelling your own account
 - **deis-controller** fixed a bug where single quotes could not be used in an environment variable
 - **deis-builder** can be used from within a proxied environment
 - **deis-database** exits if it is unable to check for existing backups in Ceph
 - Linode's provisioning script now allows for cluster expansion

### Under the Hood

 - **deis-controller** removed all the scheduler technology previews, including Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos
  - If you want to test Deis on Kubernetes, please try out the [Deis Workflow Beta](https://github.com/deis/controller/)!
 - CoreOS was updated to [899.13.0](https://coreos.com/releases/#899.13.0)
 - **deis-controller** bumped docker-py to [1.7.2](https://github.com/docker/docker-py/blob/master/docs/change_log.md#172)
 - Most components upgraded their Docker base image to [Alpine 3.3](http://www.alpinelinux.org/posts/Alpine-3.3.0-released.html)
 - All Heroku buildpacks were updated to their current release versions

For more details, please see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deis/deis/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
